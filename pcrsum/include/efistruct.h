/**
  This protocol can be used on any device handle to obtain generic path/location
  information concerning the physical device or logical device. If the handle does
  not logically map to a physical device, the handle may not necessarily support
  the device path protocol. The device path describes the location of the device
  the handle is for. The size of the Device Path can be determined from the structures
  that make up the Device Path.
